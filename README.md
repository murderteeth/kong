## requirements
- node, yarn, make, tmux, docker, docker compose
- â™¥ for zoo animals

## make
`build` - build everything

`up` - run dev services and terminal

`down` - make sure your dev environment is shutdown


## tmux cheats
`quit` - `ctrl+b`, `:` then `kill-session` (your dev environment will also shutdown gracefully)

`pane navigation` - `ctrl+b` then `arrow keys`

`zoom\unzoom pane` - `ctrl+b` then `z`

`scroll` - `ctrl+b` then `[` then `arrow keys` then `q` to quit scroll mode

## postgres x timescale
locally you can run postgres and timescale from a docker image, eg using `make postgres`. connect to your local with
```
psql --host=localhost \
  --port=5432 \
  --username=user \
  --dbname=user
```

timescale has to be manually installed on top of postgres in the render environment. bit of a pain atm
- assuming a postgres instance is already running on render
- in the render dashboard, find the Access Control panel for the pg instance and add your IP
- connect to the instance using psql from your local terminal
- `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;` to install the timescale extension
- `\dx` to verify the install
